It is true that, students of the school are taught a subject in another foreign language in addition to studying of their mother tongue. But some people argue that there is no need to pressure students by teaching it. Here, i believe that teaching a foriegn language to school students is very necessary for them. I tottaly argue that they should not be forced to do so.

On the one hand, it will be very beneficial for shcool childrens, if they can learn a foreign language during their school life, it will facilitate them at many different fields in future. For example, they are studying english. As we know english is a inter-national language. Firstly, through studying the language they will learn about the culture of that. Some school organize a program, where lectures and cultural awareness are given on this language. Secondly, students can access the information in this language. that's why they can enjoy many website, movie, cartoon, etc for acquiring their knowledge. Which are based on only english. Through these they can learn and know more new words and they will understand that how to use this. Afterward, students can be encouraged to learn foreign languages and it must be taught in a fun way, so that they do not become discouraged instead of encouraged.

On the other hand, it is not right to force school students to learn a foreign language. First reason is, by doing this they will express resentment instead of encouragement. And another reason is, students will not learn effectively by being forced alone. 

In conclusion, my opinion is i will argue that school should encourage to learn a foreign language to school students, but not completely.
